# companies api

## Description
A RESTful API that manages requests related to a database of companies, their employees, and their financial reports.

Dynamic Documentation here: https://companies-api.onrender.com/

## Overview
This project came out of the need for a teaching tool for students learning about REST APIs for the first time. The dynamic REST API documentation provides a quick reference for the endpoints and their parameters. Students also utilize the API to build a front end application that displays the data in a meaningful way.

## Tech
The API was built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. The API is hosted on Render and the database is hosted on bit.io. The front is built in JavaScript, and HTML & CSS.
